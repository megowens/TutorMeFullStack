# Tutor Me Project

This repository contains the python code for a tutoring website for University of Virginia students. It is connected to the official course catalog from the University, and gives students the option to find a tutor, or to be a tutor. Users are able to create profiles with their courses, and students are able to send requests for tutoring to other students who are signed up as tutors. This repository contains both front and back end code, written in python using django as a framework.

** Margaret Owens was the testing manager, spearheading beta and unit testing in addition to working as a developer on both the back end and front end of the app **
